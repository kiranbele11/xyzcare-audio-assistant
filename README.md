Non-technical bullet point summary of how the XYZCare system works:

**Overall Flow:**
- Voice-controlled web app for repair technicians to quickly find information in product manuals
- Users speak → system understands → shows relevant manual pages

**Step-by-Step Process:**
1. **Voice Input**: User clicks microphone and speaks (e.g., "Pixel 9 Pro manual")
2. **Speech Recognition**: System converts speech to text using AI
3. **Manual Matching**: System finds the right manual using product name matching
4. **PDF Display**: Correct manual loads in the browser for viewing
5. **Question Answering**: User asks specific questions → system finds exact pages using smart search
6. **Page Navigation**: System automatically jumps to the most relevant page

**Key Technologies:**
- Local speech-to-text (no internet needed for voice conversion)
- AI-powered semantic search (understands meaning, not just keywords)
- Fast PDF loading and navigation
- Modern web interface with real-time feedback

The system helps repair technicians find information faster by eliminating manual searching through PDFs.
